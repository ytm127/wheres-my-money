## Where's my money
Where's my money, or wmm is a tool to very manually manage your spendings.

#### Philosophy
- The modern world has removed friction from spending money. This makes spending money very quick. Think subscriptions, touch to pay, services to easily send money like Venmo.
- The modern world has integrated money spending seemlessly into everything. This makes spending money possible everywhere. You can spend money on an xbox, roku, even on Alexa.
- The modern world has increased the average person's spending throughput and latency. This makes spending money too easy, fast, and smooth. 



Money spending should have some healthy friction. To that end, this tool was created. 
Manually add every single spend every few days to keep a pulse on your spendings for the month. 
Don't worry, after a few entries, you'll be moving fast. Roughly 20 spending entries per minute. 
If this takes you a long time, you have a spending problem.
